# Changelog

## 0.3.0

- Replaced Foundry's default pause presentation with an original animated
  **SYSTEM HALTED** overlay.
- Added a rotating geometric cyberpunk dial and restrained text-glitch effect.
- Disabled pause animations when Foundry Photosensitive Mode or the operating
  system reduced-motion preference is active.

## 0.2.1

- Changed the normal overnight-rest chat heading from **Day Refresh** to
  **Good Night's Rest**.
- Changed the frail-rest chat heading to **Rest Without HP Recovery** so it
  directly matches the selected rest option.

## 0.2.0

- Added light and dark theme styling for SWNR Day Refresh and Frail Rest chat
  cards, including per-actor refresh messages that do not use SWNR's standard
  `.chat-card` class.
- Added the missing English Frail Rest localization so the result card no longer
  displays `swnr.pools.refreshSummary.frailRest`.

## 0.1.1

- Fixed mixed-theme configurations incorrectly following Foundry's Applications
  setting instead of its Interface setting.
- Chat cards now read Foundry v13's explicit `core.uiConfig.colorScheme.interface`
  preference and update when the UI configuration changes.

## 0.1.0

- Added adaptive light and dark styling for SWNR system chat cards.
- Tied card appearance to the nearest Foundry Interface theme rather than the
  separate Applications theme stored on the document body.
- Added compatible colours for CWN Combat Enhancements Target Check results.
